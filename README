Sound2Header (sound to header) is a little and simple C program that I
have done in a while using the libsndfile library to convert any sound
file supported by libsndfile to an array of samples in a range given
by the command line. So the generated file can be included in any
C/C++ souce code file. It’s intended for embedded projects where it’s
not possible to open files like when there is an operative
system. Sound2Header is free software licensed under the GNU/GPL
version 3 or later license and the code is attached. It can be easily
compiled with make as usual.

    $ make

Many thanks to Erik de Castro Lopo for creating and mantaining the
libsndfile library. Keep developing free software!
